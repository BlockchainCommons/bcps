## The Problem: Seed Fragility

Seed loss is one of the biggest dangers when practicing self-sovereign
control of digital assets. For years, the newspapers have been full of
stories of lost hard drives[^1], forgotten PINs[^2], and other mistakes
that have led to the potential loss of very valuable digital assets. The
problem with self-sovereign control of digital assets is that you’re the
one in control, with no one to back you up. Single-points-of-failure,
such as the loss of a key, can cost you everything.

To make self-sovereign control of digital assets truly work, especially
in a world where your very identity might be a digital asset, we have to
make self-sovereign custody *smarter*. We need to empower the average
user to protect their digital assets’ seeds in a way that’s very easy,
that doesn’t expose single-points-of-failure, and that doesn’t cause
process fatigue.

## The Possibilities: Multisigs & Secret Sharing

Cryptocurrencies currently offer three different methodologies where you
can divide your secret into multiple parts, and then can access your
assets using just *some* of those parts. This adds considerable
resilience to your custody solution: though you now have more secrets
(or shares of secrets) to track, you can also lose some of those secrets
(or shares) without losing your assets. There are also numerous other
advantages to these methodologies, the most notable of which is
additional protection against compromise: using a standard setup for
dividing up secrets, an attacker will need multiple secrets (or shares)
to steal your assets.

These three methodologies are:

***Multisigs.*** This is the standard methodology for locking digital
assets with a number of keys. Some or all of them may be required to
unlock the assets. When only some keys are required, which is an m-of-n
multisig, then more resilience is created. It’s ultimately a balance, as
the fewer keys that are required to unlock an asset (reducing
single-points-of-failure) corresponds to the fewer keys that are
required to steal the asset (creating single-points-of-compromise).

Multisigs would be our preferred methodology for protecting seeds if not
for some inadequacies in the modern landscape of digital custody. The
biggest is that they’re not supported by all blockchains. Ethereum
offers the biggest barrier, as multisigs are not part of the standard
custody paradigm for Ethereum (which more often depends on single master
keys) and though they are usable through some smart contracts such as
Gnosis[^3], their use can be very expensive. Even on blockchains where
multisigs are cheaply available, they remain hard to use. We recently
authored a multisig self-custody scenario[^4] and we believe the
complexity of transferring data back and forth between multiple devices
is beyond what most users are willing to do. Beyond this, current
identity standards don’t offer any support for multisigs, so the
immediate future will only see identities protected by singular keys.

***Secret Sharing.*** The other current option is to back up a secret with a
secret-sharing scheme, where a single key is used to control the secret,
but a backup of the key is sharded, such that the key can be
reconstructed from some of those shares, but not necessarily all of
them. The standard methodology to do so is Shamir’s Secret Sharing[^5],
but Verifiable Secret Sharing[^6] is another option that’s quickly
maturing and that offers new features.

Fundamentally, secret sharing schemes aren’t as safe as multisig
methodologies, because they rely on a single key that can be easily
compromised. How to protect the key as it’s reconstructed is a
particular challenge[^7]. However, secret sharing has notable advantages
in that it can be much easier to use in the modern market and it doesn’t
depend on support from a blockchain. As a result, we currently believe
that secret sharing is a prime technology for improving self-sovereign
custody, where a user controls his own digital assets in a decentralized
way.

(There are also possibilities to combine multisigs with secret sharing,
as is done in the Blockchain Commons multisig self-custody scenario, but
since those necessarily embrace usability issues with multisigs, we’re
ignoring those as a separate option for the moment.)

***Collaborative Key Generation & Usage.*** This is a next-generation
solution, where machines hold individual secrets that can be used to
generate a secret that may not exist in any form before the second that
it’s needed. This technology is still very new, though it’s in use with
architectures such as FROST[^8] and Torus[^9]. We don’t believe it’s
mature enough for our usage, though any work on addressing the problem
of self-sovereign key fragility must future-proof their architecture to
allow it to support Collaborative Key Generation & Usage.

## The Development: Our Work So Far

Because of the current advantages of secret-sharing over multisig for
solutions that support a variety of blockchains, secret-sharing has been
a focus for our Smart Custody work in the last few years. The following
articles from recent Web of Trust events detail some of our additional
thinking over the years:

-   [**“A New Approach to Social Key Recovery”**](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/social-key-recovery.md) (RWOT8 Advance Reading)[^10]. An investigation into creating multi-level secret-sharing schemes to reduce the possibility of collusion and thus compromise.
-   [**“Publicly Verifiable Split-Key Schemes for Hybrid Secret Sharing and Multisig Authorization”**](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-secret-sharing.md) (RWOT9 Advance Reading)[^11]. A discussion of the connection between social-key recovery and multisig schemes.
-   [**“Evaluating Social Schemes for Key Recovery”**](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/final-documents/evaluating-social-recovery.pdf) (RWOT8 Finished Paper)[^12]. A rubric for evaluating social-key recovery methods.
-   [**“Shamir’s Secret Sharing: An Overview”**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZJlFZcftrCM_KaxFnHUIskJKlSQzF0zFn4WIRQGDLU/edit#) (RWOT8+9 Unfinished Paper)[^13]. An unfinished (but extensive) paper from RWOT8 & 9 that discusses best practices, terminology, and more.

The work on secret-sharing schemes at RWOT 8 & 9 has also led to
Blockchain Commons’ development of an open-source secret-sharing library
called SSKR[^14]. It currently supports Shamir, but we hope to expand it
to VSS in the future. It has also received a security review[^15].

The Solution: Collaborative Seed Recovery
-----------------------------------------

Producing secure code for secret-sharing is just one step in resolving
the core problem of key fragility. As shown in part by past articles,
there’s also a need to consider both human usability and the best
practices for actually using secret-sharing schemes. Blockchain Commons
is now working on a new smart-custody solution that we call
Collaborative Seed Recovery, which we hope will answer some of these
questions.

The key features are:

-   Use of Shamir’s Secret Sharing to shard secrets.
-   New capabilities to protect larger amounts of data than Shamir can natively, thanks to use of “Envelopes”, which encrypt any amount of data through a symmetric key, which is what is actually sharded.
-   Use of platform cloud backup system as a storage locale for the first share as well as to hold metadata about where other shares are.
-   Design of share-servers, which hold shares as part of an ecosystem of secret sharing.
-   Automation so that the user doesn’t initially have to worry about the secret-sharing methodology at all.
-   Ability for the user to later choose which share servers he prefers to use to protect his digital assets.
-   Support for a variety of authentication methods on share servers, to ensure that shares are only returned to the authorized user and that the seed is protected during the vulnerable time of reconstruction.

We expect the standard storage workflow to be as follows:

1.  User uploads secret data to a CSR app.
2.  Data is encrypted with a symmetric key.
3.  Symmetric key is sharded.
4.  Envelopes are constructed, each containing encrypted data and one share.
5.  First share is stored in cloud backup associated with app’s platform.
6.  Other shares are stored with random seed servers.
7.  Information on share locations is stored with first share.

We expect the standard reconstruction workflow to be as follows:

1.  User initiates reconstruction.
2.  CSR app retrieves first share from platform cloud backup.
3.  CSR app learns where other shares are from platform cloud backup.
4.  CSR app retrieves sufficient shares from other share servers, asking user to authenticate as required.
5.  Seed is reconstructed.

More information is available from our [*article*](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md) describing CSR[^16] as well as our [videos on crypto-envelope](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ9LtDWZAkfItMF4B5tztw/videos), the foundation of CSR (the "crypto-envelope" presentation from July 15 is the first). Our [*poster*](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/posters/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr-poster.pdf) also overviews much of this information.

We believe this approach meets the needs of usability that are currently
absent from other solutions and that careful design of seed servers can
ensure that best practices are met. Blockchain Commons is currently
working with several companies to turn the CSR architecture into a
reality. We welcome additional comments and development of this
architecture here at RWOT11.
