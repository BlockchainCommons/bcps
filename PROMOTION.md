# Promoting a BCR to a BCP

The following process shall be used to promote a BCR to a BCP.

1. Choose a new BCP number.
2. Copy the text from the BCR to the BCP.
3. Replace the text in the BCR with a link to the BCP.
4. Remove any references to BCRs in the BCP.
   - BCPs shall only link to other BCPs (or other, external resources).
   - If another BCR is foundational to a BCP, then that other BCR must be promoted first.
5. Red flag any known conflicts with standards.
6. (Optionally) edit other BCRs to point to the new BCP rather than the old BCR.
